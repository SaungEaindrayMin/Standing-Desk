              Sitting has been linked to both an increased risk in depression

              increased levels of mood and energy levels. Along with improved

              Taking a stand, literally, is not just a fad - it’s a lifestyle
              change. To answer the question “are sit stand desks worth it?”,
              the short answer is, yes. So much of our modern lives are taken up
              by sitting, whether this is at work, binge watching Netflix at
              home or commuting to and from the office.
